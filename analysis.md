To find the user types, we applied unsupervised learning methods, concretely $K$-means and DBSCAN clustering. We assessed similarity based on the following properties: 
- followers count
- friends count (i.e. how many accounts the user follows)
- followers-friends ratio
- proportion of tweets
- proportion of RT
- proportion of replies
- days since account creation
- average number of statuses per month
- average number of hashtags per post
- average number of URLs per post
- average number of mentions per post
- average number of retweets per tweet
