Post data processing, we tried different ways to cluster data i.e k-means and DBSCAN. Here are some visualization and statistics about the discovered clusters.
## Analysis

The clustering gave us the following centroids. The representatives of each labels/clusters have the following properties.

### Plot of features distribution

From the features distribution, we can see the different clusters' distribution distinctively in those features, these increase the likeliness that such clusters do exist.
