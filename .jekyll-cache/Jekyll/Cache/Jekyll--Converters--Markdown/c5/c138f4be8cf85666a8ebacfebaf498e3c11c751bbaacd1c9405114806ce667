I"h<p>In this project, we made an attempt at discovering similar groups of Twitter users based on their usage of the platform. According to our hypotheses, it should be possible to detect 6 groups of users: incognito, newbie/inactive, retweeter, community builder, celebrity/business and bot/spammer. To test this hypothesis, we perform clustering. We augmented the existing statistics we had available on each ego by other quantities that we though would improve clustering. While DBSCAN did not produce satisfactory results, mostly assigning a large proportions of the users as noise, $K$-means performed better.</p>
